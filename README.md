# Spin-The-Wheel
A Simple Spin The Wheel For Prizes app built with Javascript

Replace the numbered prize awards in each position in the array with the name of the prize. In addition, you can add more prize positions in the array by adding the prizes into the array and then changing the math.random statement to reflect the number of prize positions in your prizes array.

13 prize positions
num = Math.floor(Math.random() *12 +1);

50 prize positions
num = Math.floor(Math.random() *49 +1);
